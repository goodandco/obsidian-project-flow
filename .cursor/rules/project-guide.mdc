This plugin allows to manage and simplify creating of the new projects inside Obsidian Vault.

The code of this project will be located inside the obsidian vault as `project-flow` plugin:  `<Obsidian Vault>/.obsidian/plugins/project-flow`.

### Settings

It should contain settings page. In the settings we should have a projects types configuration.
Each project has it's own Dimension. There are must be next default dimensions: 
- "1. Business"
- "2. Family"
- "3. Friends"
- "4. Personal"
- "5. Health"
- "6. Residence"

But the settings must allow a user to create additional dimensions. For that there must be a button "Add" after clicking which it includes new input text and aligned button "Save". Once user specified new Dimension and pressed save -> it must be stored and appeared in the list of dimensions.

Also, each Dimension has its own list of categories. There are some default categories for default dimensions:

For "1. Business":
- R&D
- Jobs
- OpenSource
- Education

For "2. Family":
- Vacations
- Parenting
- Common

For "4. Personal":
- R&D
- Languages
- SelfManagement
- Writing
- Reading
- Music
- Sports

For "5. Health":
- Clinics
- Issues
- R&D


### Functionality 
When plugin is invoked, it must ask Name of the project. This name must be stored as $_PROJECT_NAME variable.
Then ask for a project tag. Store that info as $_PROJECT_TAG variable.
Then it must display a list of types of the project: here it must use defined project types from the configuration. Depends of selected project type, the plugin knows in what place it must create new files and directories. 

So, after phase of collecting the infromation from user you must have next variables:

$_PROJECT_NAME -> name of the project
$_PROJECT_PARENT -> parent name
$_PROJECT_TAG -> main tag which must be included to each project related file
$_PARENT_TAG -> must be included to the Project file.

Also, there are some variables must be generated:

$_YEAR -> Current date year
$_DATE -> Current Date in format YYYY-MM-DD
$_PROJECT_FULL_NAME -> `<$_YEAR>.<$_PROJECT_PARENT>.<$_PROJECT_NAME>`
$_PROJECT_RELATIVE_PATH -> `<$_DIMENSION>/<$_CATEGORY>/<$_PROJECT_FULL_NAME>`
$_PROJECT_PATH -> `<Obsidian Value path>/<$_DIMENSION>/<$_CATEGORY>/<$_PROJECT_FULL_NAME>/<$_PROJECT_FULL_NAME>`


So eventually it must create next structure in the specified directory:

```
<$_PROJECT_PATH>/
-- /Knowledge Base/
-- /Meetings/
-- /Work/
-- /People/
-- /<$_PROJECT_FULL_NAME>.md
-- /<$_PROJECT_NAME> Meetings.md
-- /<$_PROJECT_NAME> People.md
-- /<$_PROJECT_NAME> Work.md
```

For `/<$_PROJECT_FULL_NAME>.md` use `templates/project.md` template
For `/<$_PROJECT_NAME> Meetings.md` use `templates/meetings.md` template
For `/<$_PROJECT_NAME> People.md` use `templates/people.md` template
For `/<$_PROJECT_NAME> Work.md` use `template/work.md` teamplate


### Templates

Also it must create a template folder for the project inside `<Obsidian Vault>/Templates/<$_PROJECT_NAME>_Templates`. It must include next templates:


<$_PROJECT_NAME>_Meeting_Template.md -> use 'templates/meeting.md
<$_PROJECT_NAME>_Meeting_Daily_Template.md -> use 'templates/meeting-daily.md
<$_PROJECT_NAME>_Meeting_Discusion_Template.md -> use 'templates/meeting-discussion.md
<$_PROJECT_NAME>_Meeting_Knowledge_Template.md -> use 'templates/meeting-knowledge.md
<$_PROJECT_NAME>_Meeting_Planning_Template.md -> use 'templates/meeting-planning.md
<$_PROJECT_NAME>_Meeting_Refinement_Template.md -> use 'templates/meeting-refinement.md
<$_PROJECT_NAME>_Meeting_Retro_Template.md -> use 'templates/meeting-retro.md
<$_PROJECT_NAME>_Meeting_Demo_Template.md -> use 'templates/meeting-demo.md
<$_PROJECT_NAME>_Sprint_Template.md -> use 'templates/sprint.md
<$_PROJECT_NAME>_Task_Template.md -> use 'templates/task.md
<$_PROJECT_NAME>_idea_Template.md -> use 'templates/idea.md


Each template contains defined above variables. Which must be repalced with actual values.
